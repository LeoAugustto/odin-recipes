The Odin Project: Recipes Lesson

In this project, i will develop a website for recipes with the help of "The Odin Project" website, using only HTML.
In the future, i will make changes to this site using CSS and JavaScript, to make it more beautiful, responsive and better. But for now (8-fev-2023), i am only capable to use HTML.
